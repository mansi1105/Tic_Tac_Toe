This Python project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a winning combination of three in a row. The game provides a simple yet engaging interactive experience, with player input validated to ensure fair gameplay. The program concludes when a player wins, or the game results in a draw, offering an entertaining demonstration of basic game logic and user interaction in Python.
